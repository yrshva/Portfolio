# Getting Started with NextJS App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and migrated to [NextJS App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs all the required packages

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `next` folder.\
It correctly bundles Next in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
